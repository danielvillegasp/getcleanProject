# Instructions

## Running the script

The file run_analysis.R looks up for the data in './Data/UCI HAR Dataset/', then it merges both, train and test datasets and 
creates a file in the same folder as the script 'run_analysis.R' with the results.

The working directory is set automatically to the directory containing run_analysis.R. Keep in mind that if the data is stored in a 
directory different than './Data/UCI HAR Dataset/' you would have to change this path in the variable data.dir.
